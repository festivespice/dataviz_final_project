The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in the summer semester of 2023.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find _data visualizations about rat cases in New York City_. Here's my favorite data visualization from the exploration: 

**Listing cities that handled rat cases swiftly:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored _Florida's lakes according to their position while focusing on their position on a map._ Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder. I liked finding out where clusters of lakes were in this visualization: 

**Checking out where lakes are concentrated in Florida:**

## Project 03

In `project_03`, I explored _weather data, and then text data about professor reviews from the RateMyProfessor site to perform sentiment analysis._ I decided to take up the text analysis option because I wasn't familiar with doing that and I thought I would learn the most. Here's a visualization that I had fun making:

**A part of the sentiment analysis on the words of the reviews:**

### Moving Forward

I have learned a lot in this class! I've been making data visualizations ever since my Junior year at Florida Polytechnic in the class Statistical Learning all the way up through some machine learning and other classes that used R, but I have never been as conscious as I am now about carefully designing visualizations, and the different types of visualizations that I can make as well as when they're appropriate. What I love about this class is that it's empowering: I feel like I can carefully make visualizations for almost anything that I feel like I need to make in the future. 

I'd say that the biggest area of growth for me was being conscious of what I was displaying to the user. I still struggle from time to time, but the most helpful concentrated piece of wisdom that I've learned is to strip your graph of aesthetics and color once you're done making it, so that you can iteratively and consciously add back only what's necessary to clearly tell a story that is hiding the data.

The area that needs the most growth for me is actually telling a data story, which from what I understand starts with exploring the data's statistics until an interesting pattern is found in the data that can be explained by walking a reader through different visualizations, summaries, and ways of understanding the data. 

I don't know how I'm going to use the skills that I've gained in this course, especially because it's not super related to the career I'd like to follow, but it's definitely sharpened my understanding of design and beautiful things and helped establish some skills for a bottleneck of data science: sharing your findings with others.
